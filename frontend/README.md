# Findtact

A lightweight contact manager (React + Vite frontend, Flask + Postgres backend) that lets you save contacts with tags and notes, then find them quickly using semantic search.

## What you can do

- Create, update, and delete contacts
- Add tags (e.g. `neighbor`, `coworker`, `doctor`) and freeform notes
- Run **semantic search** to find people by meaning/context, not just exact keywords
- Seed a set of demo contacts from the UI

## Semantic search examples

After you seed the demo contacts, try searches like:

- `package drop-off`
- `building manager`
- `marketing team`
- `gym buddy`
- `primary care clinic`
- `neighbor in apt 3b`
